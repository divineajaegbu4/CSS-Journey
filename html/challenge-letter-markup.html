      <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's
        Science Faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year.
        I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.
      </p>

      <section class="starting_date">
        <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
        <p>
          We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time. However, it
          would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time></li>
          <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2016-05-10">10 May 2016</time></li>
          <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2016-09-15">15 September 2016</time></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please let me know if this is okay, and if so, which start date you would prefer.
        </p>
