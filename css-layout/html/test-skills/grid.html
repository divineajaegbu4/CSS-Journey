        The CSS code grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(50px,
        auto)); combined with grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto); creates a
        flexible and responsive grid layout that can adjust itself based on the
        available screen space and the size of the content inside each grid
        item. Let’s break it down in simple terms. First, the
        grid-template-columns part tells the browser how to arrange the columns
        in the grid. By using repeat(auto-fit, minmax(50px, auto)), you're
        saying, “Hey browser, try to fit as many columns as you can on the
        screen.” Each of those columns must be at least 50 pixels wide, but they
        can grow wider if there is enough space. The auto-fit part is very
        clever because it automatically adds or removes columns based on the
        screen size, so the grid looks good on both small and big screens. Then,
        the minmax(50px, auto) part means each column cannot be smaller than 50
        pixels, but it can grow as big as needed to fit the content inside. That
        helps keep your layout from getting too squished on tiny screens, while
        still being flexible on large ones. Now, let’s talk about the rows. The
        grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto); rule tells the browser how tall
        each automatically created row should be. In this case, it means every
        new row should be at least 100 pixels tall, but it can grow taller if
        the content inside that row is too big to fit. This helps prevent
        overlapping or cut-off content. So, for example, if one grid item has
        just a short sentence, it will only take up 100 pixels in height. But if
        another item has a long paragraph or a tall image, the row will
        automatically grow taller to fit everything nicely. This keeps your
        design looking neat and clean without having to manually set heights for
        every row. Overall, this grid setup is great for building responsive
        websites because it allows your layout to adapt beautifully across
        different devices and screen sizes. You don’t have to worry about your
        content overflowing or looking messy. It also helps you avoid writing
        lots of extra media queries, because the layout automatically adjusts
        based on the space and the content. This kind of smart layout is a key
        part of modern web design, and using it means you're building your
        website the right way — clean, flexible, and future-proof.
