        Learning web development is like building a house from the ground up. At
        first, everything may seem confusing — there are many tools, rules, and
        steps. But as you keep going, each small piece starts to make sense.
        HTML is like the bricks that form the structure, CSS is the paint and
        decoration that make the house beautiful, and JavaScript is the
        electricity that brings it to life. You begin by learning how to create
        simple pages, then you style them, and eventually, you make them
        interactive and smart. The more you practice, the clearer everything
        becomes. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed at first — that’s part of the
        journey. What matters most is staying curious, asking questions, and
        building something new every day. With time, patience, and effort,
        you'll not only understand how websites work, but you'll also be able to
        build ones that people love to use. Learning web development is like
